# lodash in Typescript, and shrinked

## Installation

In a browser:
You can use webpack for your project.

Using npm:
```shell
$ npm i --save lodash-ts
```

In Node.js:
```ts
import isArray from 'lodash-ts/isArray';
```

**Note:**<br>

## Why Lodash-ts?

Lodash is good, but sometimes it makes our project(specially the web project) very heavy.
